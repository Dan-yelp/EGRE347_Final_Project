The purpose and process behind this module are detailed in "EGRE347_FinalProject_DanMehmet".

The two directories of concern are "Tracking_Module_cpp", and "Tracking_Module_py". The two directories generally have the same algorithm, and are a useful comparison between C++ and Python.  


See READMEs in "Tracking_Module_cpp", and "Tracking_Module_py" separately for their respective usage.
